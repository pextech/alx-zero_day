## Description

This is a very Beginning of my course at ALX and Holberton's courses.

## Tasks included 🔧

- Adding all Required files
- every file contains commands only to deliver a given task

## NB: 

All files that are in the 0x01-emacs folder , if you assumed well they have a `~` at the end of the filename evethough i've added this in the .gitignore.
the reason for this is that i've comitted everything before adding this .gitignore.
